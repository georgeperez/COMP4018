# Master Development Plan

The project's development plan is being scheduled and monitored with a Kanban board  as part of the GitHub service. To see the development progress, please see the [Issues](https://github.com/mambadb/mambadb/issues/) section to see how work is being assigned and worked on.

## General Project Plan

Our general development plan is _still_ to finish the architectural needs of our selected development frameworks. We have a database instance up right now hosted on Digitalocean, with a simple webserver serving a simple website at [https://mambadb.titanpointe.org/](mambadb.titanpointe.org) (no proper frontend code, just boilerplate HTML5). Sketch is up at [../media/wireframe/](../media/wireframe/) folder (this data should be evaluated concurrently with the [RDD](../sprint-0/requirements-definition-document.md)).
